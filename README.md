# ALX Project Nexus

This repository serves as a documentation hub for my major learnings from the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering** program. It showcases my understanding of backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices.

---

## 🚀 Overview of the Program

The **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering** program provided in-depth training in backend development, covering key technologies, architectural patterns, and real-world best practices. This repository summarizes my learnings, challenges, and key takeaways.

---

## 📌 Key Technologies Covered

- **Python** - Core language for backend development.
- **Django** - Web framework for building scalable applications.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** - For creating RESTful APIs.
- **GraphQL** - Query language for efficient API interactions.
- **Docker** - Containerization for deploying applications.
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment)** - Automating the development workflow.

## 🔍 Important Backend Development Concepts

### 🔹 Database Design  
- Understanding **SQL vs. NoSQL** databases.  
- Designing **normalized schemas** for efficient queries.  
- Implementing **Django ORM** for database interactions.  

### 🔹 Asynchronous Programming  
- Using Python’s **asyncio** for handling concurrent tasks.  
- Implementing **Celery** for background job processing.  

### 🔹 Caching Strategies  
- Implementing **Redis** for performance optimization.  
- Using Django’s built-in **caching framework** to reduce database queries.

## 💡 Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

1. **Handling Authentication & Authorization**  
   - Faced issues with JWT token expiration in DRF.  
   - **Solution:** Implemented token refresh logic and session authentication.  

2. **Efficient Querying in Django**  
   - Challenge: Slow database queries due to **N+1** problems.  
   - **Solution:** Used **select_related** & **prefetch_related** to optimize queries.  

3. **Dockerizing Django Applications**  
   - Faced issues with environment variable management in Docker.  
   - **Solution:** Used `.env` files and `docker-compose` for better config management.

## 🏆 Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

✅ **Write modular & reusable code** to improve maintainability.  
✅ **Use environment variables** instead of hardcoded secrets.  
✅ **Implement proper logging & monitoring** for debugging.  
✅ **Write tests** (unit & integration) to ensure application stability.  
✅ **Follow RESTful principles** and API documentation (Swagger/Postman).
